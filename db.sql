For more on this, visit the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ7PJOwSh8k">Science Communications Fellows talks page</a>&nbsp;on YouTube.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Joining the conversation.</strong>&nbsp;In this session, Googler Chris Messina, a developer advocate, took the Fellows on a journey into the social web, illustrating by examples the power of the crowd in shaping ideas and building understanding across diverse social networks. You can view Chris&rsquo;s outstanding talk&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrTSiO9ejOs">here</a>.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Several external experts participated in the workshop as well, including Andy Revkin,&nbsp;<a href="http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/">Dot Earth</a>&nbsp;blogger and senior fellow of environmental understanding at Pace University. Andy gave a thought-provoking&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU_4OR3hOyo">keynote</a>&nbsp;the first evening, which also included a self-composed ditty about the fossil age (look out&nbsp;<em>Schoolhouse Rock!</em>).<br /><br />Armed with new knowledge on &ldquo;webbing the gap,&rdquo; the Fellows are now developing project proposals to put what they learned into practice. Proposal selections will be made later this summer. You can learn more about tools for science communication in the digital age and the innovation workshop at our site&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/edu/science/">here</a>. Stay tuned for future opportunities for participating in this program.</p>', 19, 0),
