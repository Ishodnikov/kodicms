By 1998 they had formalized their work, creating the company you know today as Google.</p>
<p>Since then, Google has grown by leaps and bounds. From offering search in a single language we now offer dozens of products and services&mdash;including various forms of advertising and web applications for all kinds of tasks&mdash;in scores of languages. And starting from two computer science students in a university dorm room, we now have thousands of employees and offices around the world.</p>
<p>On these pages, you can find more information about Google&rsquo;s products and services, our principles, history, company culture and more. A lot has changed since the first Google search engine appeared. But some things haven&rsquo;t changed: our dedication to our users and our belief in the possibilities of the Internet itself.</p>";}}
